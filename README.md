# 🎗️ Tumor Diagnosis Challenge: Cell-Graph Node Classification

## Welcome to the Tumor Diagnosis Challenge 🚀

This competition bridges **Biomedical Engineering** and **Graph Machine Learning**. Your task is to build a model that can diagnose the type of a cell (Tumor, Stroma, Immune, etc.) based on its features and its spatial neighbors in a tissue biopsy.

---

## 🎯 The Task: Inductive Node Classification

You are provided with **cell graphs** constructed from H&E stained histology images.

- **Training Phase:** You receive full graphs (nodes, edges, and labels) from a set of patients (e.g., Patient A, Patient B).
- **Testing Phase:** You must predict the cell types for **completely unseen patients** (e.g., Patient C).

### 🔍 Why "Inductive"?

Unlike standard transductive tasks (like Cora), the test nodes belong to **entirely new graphs** (new tissue slides) that were not present during training. Your model must learn **general rules** about tissue organization, not just memorize a specific graph structure.

## 📂 The Dataset (NuCLS-Based)

The data is derived from the [NuCLS dataset](https://nucls.grand-challenge.org/) (breast cancer).

### 🏗️ Graph Construction Pipeline

The graph was built using the following inductive pipeline to ensure biological realism:
```
[ Histology Image ]  -->  [ Cell Detection ]  -->  [ Graph Construction ]
       🖼️                       📍                        🕸️
   (Raw Pixels)            (Centroids x,y)           (Nodes + Edges)
                                                            |
                                                    (k-NN Neighbors)
```

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Node Definition** | Raw bounding boxes from NuCLS were converted into centroids `(x, y)`. Each node represents a single cell nucleus. |
| **Edge Construction (k-NN)** | For every cell, we computed its **5 nearest spatial neighbors** within the same tissue image. Edges represent the local tissue microenvironment (e.g., cell–cell interactions). Edges strictly connect cells within the same image — no edges between different patients. |
| **Inductive Split** | Dataset was split by **Image ID**, not by random cells. Training graph = 80% of tissue images. Test graph = remaining 20% (completely unseen patients). |
| **Feature Normalization** | Node features `(x, y, width, height)` are standardized (zero mean, unit variance) for stable GNN training. |

## 1. Graph Components

- **Nodes:** Individual cells (nuclei)
- **Edges:** Spatial proximity via k-Nearest Neighbors (`k=5`). Physically close cells are connected.

### Node Features (X)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `x`, `y` | Normalized spatial coordinates |
| `width`, `height` | Morphological features of the nucleus |

### Labels (Y)

| Label | Cell Type | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `0` | Tumor | Malignant cells |
| `1` | Stromal | Connective tissue |
| `2` | Lymphocyte | Immune cells |
| `3` | Macrophage | Immune cells |

---

## 2. File Structure (`data/public/`)

| File | Description | Columns |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `train.csv` | Training nodes with labels | `id, x, y, width, height, label` |
| `edge_list.csv` | Edges for the training graph | `source, target` |
| `test_nodes.csv` | Unseen test nodes (no labels) | `id, x, y, width, height` |
| `test_edges.csv` | Edges for the test graph | `source, target` |
| `sample_submission.csv` | Example submission format | — |

---

## 📝 Submission Format

Create a single CSV file named `predictions.csv`.
```csv
id,label
41269,0
41270,2
...
```

**Requirements:**
- Header must be exactly: `id,label`
- One row per test node
- Labels must be integers in `[0–3]`

## 🚀 How to Participate

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emmakowu3579-ui/inductive-class-challenge.git
cd inductive-class-challenge
pip install -r starter_code/requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Baseline Model

A simple PyTorch GCN baseline is provided in the `starter_code/` directory.
```bash
python starter_code/baseline.py
```

This will:
- Train a basic GCN on the training graph
- Generate a submission file at `submissions/baseline_submission.csv`

### 3️⃣ Encrypt Your Submission

To preserve privacy, you **must encrypt** your CSV file before uploading. Do not upload raw CSV files.
```bash
# Usage: python starter_code/encrypt.py <path_to_your_csv>
python starter_code/encrypt.py submissions/predictions.csv
```

This creates `submissions/predictions.csv.enc`.

### 4️⃣ Submit via GitHub

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Do **NOT** commit the raw `.csv` file.
```bash
git add submissions/predictions.csv.enc
git commit -m "Submission: Team Name"
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

Then open a **Pull Request** against the `main` branch on GitHub.
